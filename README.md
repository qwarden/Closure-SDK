# A Geometric Computer

![Gray Game — Edge regime](gray-game.png)

A complete cognitive architecture on one manifold: S³, the unit 3-sphere.
Every brain state is a unit quaternion. Every update is a Hamilton product.
One arithmetic operation. Five layers. Turing-complete.

## What this is

The brain runs a single loop: ingest a carrier, compare the current state against
what the genome predicts, measure the geodesic distance σ. When σ crosses π/4 —
the BKT phase boundary on S³, the Hopf equator — the brain closes: writes to the
genome, updates the hierarchy, corrects its prediction. Learning is repeated closure.
Convergence is a fixed-point theorem.

Five layers build upward from S³:

```
substrate → memory → execution → brain → learning
```

Each layer uses only the layer beneath it. The same Hamilton product that encodes a
unit quaternion rotation also runs a Minsky machine, reads the genome, and integrates
the perceptual field. There is no other arithmetic.

## Experiments

**[Run in the browser →](https://faltz009.github.io/Closure-SDK/experiments.html)**
Conway's GoL on S³ and the Gray Game (three interference modes) running live in JS — no install required.

Terminal visualizers (require true-color support):

```bash
cargo run --example gol_live --release           # Conway's GoL on S³, pattern selector
cargo run --example gray_game_live --release     # Gray Game: spectrum / resonance / edge
```

## What you get

```
Identity maintenance      A?=A at any scale. One comparison.
                          σ = 0 at perfect coherence.
                          σ = π/4 at the Hopf equator — the closure threshold.

Two incident types        Missing record (W axis breaks) or reorder (RGB axes break).
                          Algebraic inverses. There is no third type.

Carrier channels          R = salience (X) — the [Total, Unknown] commutator.
                          G = total    (Y) — the full field; the prior.
                          B = unknown  (Z) — what has not been integrated.
                          Known = G − B. Yellow = learned. Blue = novel.

Factorized addressing     Axis queries find semantic type (S²).
                          Angle queries find cyclic position (S¹).
                          Full queries find the exact carrier (S³).

Field resonance           ZREAD reads the genome by proximity, not exact match.
                          Query strength falls as cos(σ), cuts off at σ = π/3.

Genome persistence        DNA layer bootstraps from orbit seeds. Permanent.
                          Epigenetic layer learns from ingest. Consolidates.

Turing completeness       2-counter Minsky machine and FRACTRAN on the carrier substrate.

BrainState serialization  Full state serializes to JSON. Exact round-trip.

## Enkidu-Alive

An agent with two drives: hunger σ(state, food) and cold σ(state, shelter).
Both are geodesic distances on S³. When both are zero the agent is at IDENTITY —
the algebraic identity element is homeostasis. One comparison per tick. No reward
function. No learned policy. The geometry produces the gradient.

## The SDK

The same Hamilton product applied to data integrity. Any ordered byte sequence
composes on S³; if the sequence is intact the product closes; if not, the gap tells
you exactly what broke and where. Built on the same Rust core.

```bash
pip install closure-sdk
```
