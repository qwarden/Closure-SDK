"""The canon — finds what's true, where it broke, and how.

Two composition modes, same classification:

    Static mode (localize_all):
        Both streams are complete. Compose both on S³, binary-search for
        the first divergence, classify it, remove the pair, recompose,
        repeat. Because we have the full picture, we know instantly
        whether a record is missing or reordered.
        O(k · n · log n) where k is the number of incidents.

    Stream mode (StreamClassifier):
        Records arrive one at a time. We cannot see the future, so every
        unmatched record is initially a missing record — that is literally
        what it is at the present moment. The question is whether it STAYS
        missing or gets reclassified as a reorder when its match arrives
        late on the other side.

        The rolling counter makes this uncertainty explicit. Each cycle,
        for every unresolved record, it asks one binary question:

            "Is this an invertibility of payload (has or hasn't)
             or an invertibility of position (arrived late)?"

        Three things can happen when a new record arrives:

            1. Both sides receive the same package → coherent, no incident.
            2. One side receives a package that will arrive late → reorder.
            3. One side receives a package that will never arrive → missing.

        We can't distinguish 2 from 3 at arrival time. The grace period
        is a bounded wait that turns this into a decision: hold the record
        as "unresolved" for one cycle. If its match arrives next cycle,
        reclassify missing → reorder. If not, promote to missing.

        After a misalignment, the NEXT step has only two possible outcomes:
        either the late record arrives (good — reclassify to reorder), or
        another missing record arrives (bad — but it's the same case again,
        same binary question, same grace period). The solution is recursive:
        each new unresolved record gets the same treatment, the same bounded
        wait, the same binary decision. Errors chain but the tool chains
        with them.

Also here:

    IncidentReport   — the report. One incident: what type (missing or
                       reorder), which positions in each stream, the actual
                       record bytes, and how many search steps it took.

    RetentionWindow  — the evidence archive. A rolling buffer that stores
                       raw records so they're available when the Seer
                       detects drift and you need to investigate.
