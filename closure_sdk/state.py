"""Answer formats — the shapes that come back from the tools.

When the tools in ops.py and the machines in monitor/path/tree do
their work, they return their answers in one of these three formats.
These are containers, not operations — they hold results, they don't
compute anything.

Formats:
    ClosureState        — a point on the ball. Returned by embed, compose,
                          invert, diff, and the .state() method on machines.
    CompareResult       — a drift number and a coherent flag. Returned by compare.
    LocalizationResult  — a position and a step count. Returned by localize_against.
