"""Closure SDK — identity composition on S³.

Any ordered data can be composed on the ball (S³, unit quaternions).
Two copies of the same data land on the same point. When they diverge,
the distance from identity tells you how much, and the color channels
tell you what kind.

The ball (composition and measurement):
    embed         — bytes become a point on the ball
    compose       — two points become one (the closure operation)
    invert        — the opposite of any point (the undo)
    sigma         — distance from identity (the thermometer)
    diff          — the gap between two points
    compare       — the gap as a yes/no verdict

Lenses (observe the composition at different focal lengths):
    Seer          — the sensor. Streaming, O(1), detects drift.
    Oracle        — the recorder. Full history, O(log n), finds where.
    Witness       — the template. Reference vs test, finds corruption.

The chain (translates ball geometry into color channels):
    expose            — any point → Valence(σ, RGB, W)
    expose_incident   — incident → IncidentValence with labels
    Valence           — σ + base(R,G,B) + phase(W)
    IncidentValence   — channels + positions + payload + axis

The canon (finds what broke):
    gilgamesh         — static: compose, narrow, classify
    Enkidu            — stream: match, wait, promote, reclassify
    IncidentReport    — one incident: type, positions, payload

Answer formats:
    ClosureState       — a point on the ball
    CompareResult      — drift number + coherent flag
    LocalizationResult — position + search steps
