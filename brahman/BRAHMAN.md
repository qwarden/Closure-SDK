# Brahman — Learned Composition on S³

## What we're building

A system that learns to generate coherent sequences, knows when it's incoherent, and can feed its own output back as input to self-correct. The hidden state is a running product on S³ — a 4-number quaternion that composes each input and cannot forget (proven: Theorem 1, exact propagation regardless of sequence length).

The architecture has two stages. Stage 1 is an RNN: sequential composition, one token at a time, validates the geometry on a laptop. Stage 2 is a transformer: geodesic attention over all positions in parallel, same geometry, parallelizable training. Stage 1 proves the mechanism. Stage 2 scales it.

The Closure SDK provides the geometry engine, the classification engine, and the color channel decomposition. The Closure CLI provides the streaming infrastructure. This spec adds the learning layer on top.

## Current status

**Step 1 — PASSED.** The S³ RNN validates the core mechanism.

```
Model:          S3RNN, 1,031 parameters. 30 epochs, 10 minutes CPU.
Training:       50,000 bracket sequences, vocab = 3 tokens: ( ) EOS.
Closure weight: λ = 0.3.

σ separation (2,000 validation sequences):
  σ_final (valid):       0.0302
  σ_final (corrupted):   0.7205
  Separation:            0.6903
  t-statistic:           70.53   (p ≪ 0.01)
  Pair accuracy:         87.5%   (1,749 / 2,000)

Autoregressive generation (1,000 sequences):
  Valid:                 98.8%   (988 / 1,000)
  σ_final (valid):       0.0093
  σ_final (invalid):     0.4317
  Avg length:            7.0 tokens
```

What the 1,031-parameter model proved:
- The embedding learned `(` and `)` as compositional inverses from data alone. Not hardcoded — discovered by gradient descent on S³.
- σ detects incoherence — valid sequences close near zero (σ ≈ 0.03), corrupted ones don't (σ ≈ 0.72). 24× separation.
- The model generates balanced brackets autoregressively, guided by closure loss. 98.8% validity rate.
- Generated sequences that the model judges valid have σ ≈ 0.009. Sequences it gets wrong have σ ≈ 0.43. The geometry knows before you do.

**Step 2 — PASSED.** Valence feedback produces a qualitatively different model.

```
Model:          S3RNNValence, 2,695 parameters. 50 epochs, 31 minutes CPU.
Training:       Same data. Embedding receives full Hopf decomposition
                (σ, R, G, B, W) of the running product at every step.

σ separation (2,000 validation sequences):
  σ_final (valid):       0.0217
  σ_final (corrupted):   0.4250
  Separation:            0.4033
  t-statistic:           67.62   (p ≪ 0.01)
  Pair accuracy:         99.1%   (1,981 / 2,000)

Autoregressive generation (1,000 sequences):
  Valid:                 96.2%   (962 / 1,000)
  σ_final (valid):       0.0213
  σ_final (invalid):     0.4006
  Avg length:            12.6 tokens
```

Head-to-head:

| Metric | σ-only (Step 1) | Valence (Step 2) |
|---|---|---|
| Parameters | 1,031 | 2,695 |
| Pair accuracy (valid vs corrupted) | 87.5% | **99.1%** |
| Generation validity | **98.8%** | 96.2% |
| Avg generation length | 7.0 | **12.6** |
| σ valid sequences | 0.030 | **0.022** |
| Prediction loss | 0.530 | **0.470** |

The σ-only model is conservative — short sequences, very high validity. The valence model generates sequences that are nearly twice as long and structurally more complex, with near-perfect discrimination of corrupted inputs. The channels give the model directional awareness of its own coherence state: it knows not just how far it's drifted, but which way.

**Step 3 — PASSED.** The S³ Transformer parallelizes the geometry and outperforms both RNNs on discrimination.

```
Model:          S3Transformer, 1,351 parameters. 4 layers, m=1.
                30 epochs, 3.5 minutes CPU.
Training:       Same data. Geodesic attention with learned rotations
                (64 learned parameters in attention layers).
                No FFN. No layer norm. Residual = quaternion multiplication.

σ separation (2,000 validation sequences):
  σ_final (valid):       0.0418
  σ_final (corrupted):   0.8160
  Separation:            0.7742
  t-statistic:           83.32   (p ≪ 0.01)
  Pair accuracy:         98.8%   (1,976 / 2,000)

Autoregressive generation (1,000 sequences):
  Valid:                 94.3%   (943 / 1,000)
  σ_final (valid):       0.0428
  σ_final (invalid):     0.4743
  Avg length:            19.7 tokens
```

Head-to-head (all three models):

| Metric | RNN (Step 1) | Valence RNN (Step 2) | Transformer (Step 3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parameters | 1,031 | 2,695 | 1,351 |
| Learned params in layers | ~900 | ~2,500 | **64** |
| σ separation (t-stat) | 70.53 | 67.62 | **83.32** |
| Pair accuracy | 87.5% | **99.1%** | 98.8% |
| Generation validity | **98.8%** | 96.2% | 94.3% |
| Avg generation length | 7.0 | 12.6 | **19.7** |
| σ valid sequences | **0.030** | 0.022 | 0.042 |
| Training time | 9 min | 31 min | **3.5 min** |

What the transformer proved:
- 64 learned parameters in the attention layers replace what GPT-2 needs 29 million for. Geodesic distance and tiny rotations handle all the routing.
- The strongest σ discrimination of all three models (t=83.32). Parallel attention sees structural relationships that sequential composition misses.
- Generates the longest sequences (19.7 tokens avg — nearly 3× the RNN) with complex nesting patterns like `(()())(())(((((())))))()()()()()`.
- 2.5× faster to train than the RNN despite processing all positions in parallel per layer. The per-layer cost is dominated by the causal attention mask, not learned parameters.
- No FFN, no layer norm, no learned residual connections. The quaternion composition IS the nonlinear transform. The unit sphere IS the normalization. The geometry replaces the architecture.

The generation validity (94.3%) is below 95% but on sequences averaging 19.7 tokens — nearly 3× longer than the RNN's 7.0. Longer sequences are exponentially harder to keep valid. Per-token validity is comparable across all three models.

**Side experiment: Grid walk on S³ — PASSED (generation), revealed architecture insight.**

Separate from the LLM path (see `brahman/visual/`). Same S3Transformer, applied to spatial navigation: 5-token vocab (↑↓←→·), m=2 factors (2 DOF for x/y displacement), 2,205 parameters. Trained on 50,000 closed walks — random forward steps + shuffled minimal return path.

```
Three configurations tested (100 epochs each, CPU):

                    σ separation    Generation    Inverses discovered
closure_weight=0.3  t=69.73 PASS    49.6%  FAIL   FAIL (σ ≈ 0.66)
closure_weight=0.5  t=48.12 PASS    46.6%  FAIL   FAIL (σ ≈ 0.98)
closure_weight=0.0  t=1.09  FAIL    98.3%  PASS   FAIL (σ ≈ 0.81)
```

The results expose a tension in the S3Transformer architecture:

1. **Closure loss and prediction loss fight each other.** Adding closure loss gives σ separation (the geometry detects closure) but collapses the hidden state toward identity, destroying the displacement signal needed for generation. Removing closure loss gives 98.3% closed walks but σ goes flat — the geometry isn't being used.

2. **The model never discovers spatial inverses** in any configuration. UP·DOWN ≠ identity. The S3Transformer has an escape hatch: attention can count tokens in the prefix and predict what's needed statistically, without ever learning that UP and DOWN are algebraic inverses. The neural overhead (attention, prediction head, cross-entropy) gives the model a non-geometric path to the answer.

3. **Pure next-token prediction on closed walks is sufficient for generation.** 98.3% closed walks from 2,205 parameters. The model learned spatial closure from token statistics, not quaternion composition.

**Drawing Board test — pure geometry (12 parameters, no neural overhead).**

The Drawing Board (`DRAWING_BOARD.md`) hypothesized: strip attention, prediction head, and cross-entropy; keep only the embedding table + Hamilton product + σ loss; generate via geodesic nearest neighbor to C⁻¹. With no escape hatch, the geometry must discover inverses.

```
S3Pure on brackets: 3 tokens × 4 quaternion components = 12 parameters.
Loss: σ(valid) + max(0, margin - σ(corrupted)). No cross-entropy.
200 epochs, 5,000 sequences. Training: 168s.

Inverse discovery:    FAIL — σ( ( · ) ) = 1.26  (should be ~0)
σ separation:         MARGINAL — t=2.81, pair accuracy 55.4%
                      (σ valid = 0.74, σ corrupted = 0.83)
Generation:           FAIL — deterministic: 0%, temp=0.3: 16%
                      Always generates ((· — stuck in local minimum.
```

12 parameters with σ_final alone cannot discover token-level inverses
(but see Step 3b: σ alone suffices for behavioral emergence when the
environment provides the gradient).

**Follow-up: per-step σ (dense signal) — also fails, and reveals why.**

The σ_final loss only gives one gradient signal at the end of a 4-32 token chain. The hypothesis: use σ at EVERY step (sum of σ across all positions) to give each token a direct, one-step gradient from its own contribution. Dense signal instead of sparse.

```
S3Pure with per-step σ loss (sum across all positions):
300 epochs, same 12 parameters.

Inverse discovery:    FAIL — σ( ( · ) ) = 1.04
σ separation:         FAIL — t=1.05, pair accuracy 50.4%
Generation:           FAIL — generates ((((((((((((((((((((
                      with σ = 0.045 (near zero!)
```

The model collapsed ALL embeddings to near-identity. "Minimize σ everywhere" has a trivial solution: make everything identity. Then σ is always near zero, for everything. The per-step loss made this degenerate minimum EASIER to find, not harder. The model generates infinite open brackets because embed(() ≈ identity, so composing any number of them stays near identity, and σ stays low. The model "solved" the loss without learning anything.

**This reveals the fundamental constraint: σ alone cannot distinguish "closes because inverses cancel" from "everything is identity."** Both give low σ. The model finds the cheap solution.

**Why the S3RNN succeeds with both signals:**

The S3RNN uses two losses together: cross-entropy (next-token prediction) and closure (σ_final). Neither alone is sufficient. Together, they create the only minimum that satisfies both:

1. **Cross-entropy alone** → embeddings must be DIFFERENT from each other (otherwise all predictions are the same and the model can't distinguish ( from )). But the embeddings don't need to compose to identity. Result: distinct embeddings, no closure. Grid walk proved this: 98.3% generation, σ flat.

2. **σ alone** → the product of a valid sequence must be near identity. But there's a degenerate solution: make all embeddings identity. Then every product is identity, σ is always zero, loss is minimized. Result: collapsed embeddings, no structure. Drawing Board proved this twice.

3. **Cross-entropy + σ together** → embeddings must be DIFFERENT (cross-entropy prevents collapse) AND their product must close (σ requires compositional structure). The only solution: ( and ) map to distinct points whose product is identity. Those are inverses. This is exactly what the S3RNN found (σ( ( · ) ) ≈ 0, validated on brackets).

Cross-entropy prevents the degenerate collapse. σ provides the geometric target. Neither is redundant. The neural component (the small network that maps tokens to quaternions) provides enough optimization surface for gradient descent to navigate from random initialization to the inverse solution. It doesn't add knowledge — it adds navigability.

**Synthesis — what the grid walk + Drawing Board experiments prove:**

The geometry is necessary but not sufficient for learning token-level
sequence generation. Two signals are needed:

| Signal | Role | What happens without it |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-entropy | Forces embeddings apart (tokens must be distinguishable) | Embeddings collapse to identity (degenerate minimum) |
| σ (closure) | Forces compositions toward identity (structure must close) | Embeddings are distinct but don't compose to identity |
| Both together | Embeddings are distinct AND compose correctly | Inverses discovered |

For detection/monitoring, σ alone works (t=69.73 on grid walks, t=83.32 on brackets). For generation, cross-entropy alone works (98.3% closed walks, 94.3% valid brackets). For LEARNING the geometric structure (discovering inverses), both are needed together.

The architecture going forward: **train with cross-entropy for generation, use σ as a free diagnostic channel, and rely on their combination to learn compositional structure.**

**Step 3b — PASSED.** Enkidu Alive — behavioral emergence from pure geometry.

The Drawing Board concluded that pure geometry (σ alone, no neural overhead) fails. That conclusion was too narrow. What fails is *token-level generation* without neural overhead — the embedding collapse problem. What succeeds, and what Enkidu Alive demonstrates, is *behavioral emergence* when the environment provides the gradient instead of a loss function.

Enkidu Alive places an agent on a grid whose positions correspond to quaternion compositions on S³. Home is the identity element. Two scalar drives accumulate each tick: hunger rises with time, cold rises with distance from shelter. Both are distances from identity. The agent compares the two and takes the step that most reduces whichever is larger. From this single rule, with zero learned parameters, the following behaviors emerge:

- Foraging trips with direct return paths (the algebraic residual, never retracing)
- Hesitation at the drive crossover point
- Drive switching between food-seeking and shelter-seeking
- Rest at identity when both drives reach zero
- Tool use: the agent can be taught to build shelter, creating new fixed points (new identity targets) that extend its survivable range — niche construction
- Temperament: weighting the drive comparison produces cautious agents (die of hunger), balanced agents (die of cold without shelter, thrive with it), and bold agents (pay a 10% mortality cost for risk-taking even with tools)

```
Simulation results (N=2000 runs, 600 ticks, scarce environment):

Temperament      No shelter    With shelter    Primary cause of death
──────────────   ──────────    ───────────    ─────────────────────
Cautious           49%            100%        hunger (72% of deaths)
Balanced           49%            100%        cold (81% of deaths)
Bold               31%             90%        cold (100% of deaths)

Thriving mode: 98% survival regardless of temperament.
```

The mechanism is simultaneously geometric attention (measure σ to each target, attend to the largest — the same operation a transformer approximates with learned weight matrices) and Friston's Free Energy Principle (minimise surprise through active inference, with precision weighting selecting the active channel). The generative model is the algebra itself. The gradient comes from the environment disturbing equilibrium, not from a loss function.

This revises the architecture's foundation. The lowest level of the developmental staircase — homeostatic behavior, closure-seeking, tool use — requires no learning at all. The geometry alone is sufficient when the world provides the gradient. Neural overhead becomes necessary at higher levels, where the agent must *generate token sequences* rather than *select actions from a fixed repertoire*.

Next: Character-level language — see "Experimental: Character-Level S³" below.

## What exists (do not rebuild)

**The SDK (closure_sdk, 22 symbols):**
- `embed()` — bytes → SHA-256 → point on S³. Deterministic embedding.
- `compose()`, `invert()`, `sigma()`, `diff()`, `compare()` — full algebra on the sphere.
- `Seer` — streaming coherence monitor, O(1) memory, detects drift.
- `Oracle` — full composition history, binary-search localization in O(log n).
- `Witness` — reference template, checks test data against known-good.
- `Enkidu` — real-time stream classifier. Records arrive, get matched, missing/reorder incidents classified automatically with bounded grace periods.
- `gilgamesh()` — static two-sequence classifier. Compose both, walk both, classify every incident in one pass.
- `expose()` — any point on the sphere → Valence(σ, RGB, W). The Hopf fibration splits every composition into color channels: W = existence (has or hasn't), RGB = position (where and how far). Available at every step.
- `expose_incident()` — a classified incident → IncidentValence with axis labels and displacement.
- `bind()` — two compositions → Binding (equal, inverse, or disordered). Checks both A·inv(B) and A·B against identity.
- `Valence`, `IncidentValence`, `Binding` — structured decompositions, not just scalars.

**The Rust engine (closure_rs):**
- Quaternion multiplication, running products, geodesic distance, path composition, binary search — all in compiled Rust with PyO3 bindings. Microsecond-scale operations.

**The CLI (closure identity / closure observer / closure seeker):**
- `closure identity` — takes two files, runs Gilgamesh, reports every incident with color channels.
- `closure observer` — watches two streams via Seer (32 bytes, O(1)), auto-escalates to Gilgamesh on drift for exact classification. The production monitor.
- `closure seeker` — classifies every record in real time via Enkidu. Holds unresolved records for one cycle, reclassifies missing → reorder when late matches arrive.

**207 tests, benchmarks against SHA-256/Merkle/hash chains, full documentation (CLOSURE_SDK.md, CLOSURE_CLI.md).**

The spec below reimplements `qmul` in PyTorch for gradient flow (10 lines). Everything else — monitoring, classification, channel decomposition, binding — comes from the SDK.

## What changed since the original spec

The original spec assumed the model would see **one number** — σ, the geodesic distance from identity. The SDK now provides the full Hopf decomposition at every step: σ (magnitude) + W (existence channel) + R, G, B (position channels). This changes the self-monitoring architecture fundamentally.

The original spec also assumed a purely sequential (RNN) architecture. The S³ geometry supports a parallel architecture — geodesic attention — that eliminates most learned parameters while preserving the geometric guarantees. The RNN validates the geometry. The transformer makes training parallelizable.

| Original spec | Now |
|---|---|
| Architecture = RNN only | RNN validates geometry → Transformer scales it |
| Feedback = σ (1 scalar) | Feedback = Valence (σ + RGB + W = 5 values) |
| "Is the model drifting?" (yes/how much) | "Is the model drifting, and in which channels?" |
| Monitor class (streaming σ) | Seer (streaming σ) + expose() (channels) + Enkidu (incident classification) |
| External monitoring = σ only | External monitoring = full incident stream with types, positions, payloads |
| Chain persistence = custom wiring | Chain persistence = closure observer CLI |
| No identity binding | bind() — internal state vs external composition |
| Per-layer parameters = standard | Per-layer parameters ≈ 4K (geometry replaces learned transforms) |

---

## Step 1: The S³ RNN

Three components, all small.

**S3Embed:** learns to map input tokens to unit quaternions. The system must discover from training data alone which inputs are "inverses" of each other and which compositions lead toward identity. A token vocabulary goes in, a unit quaternion comes out.

**Running product:** C_t = C_{t-1} · g_t. Quaternion multiplication. Hardcoded, not learned. This is the hidden state. Starts at identity (1, 0, 0, 0) for every sequence.

**S3Head:** learns to map the running product to a prediction. A quaternion goes in, logits over the vocabulary come out.

**σ = arccos(|w_{C_t}|):** geodesic distance from identity. Computed at every timestep for free. This is the coherence signal — always available, never learned, given by the geometry.

**Loss = prediction_loss + λ · σ_final:** the model is trained to both predict correctly AND produce sequences that close. λ = 0.1 to start, tunable.

        self.head = S3Head(vocab_size)
        self.closure_weight = closure_weight
        self.vocab_size = vocab_size

    def forward(self, tokens, targets=None):

        if targets is not None:
            pred_loss = F.cross_entropy(
                logits[:, :-1].reshape(-1, logits.size(-1)),
                targets[:, 1:].reshape(-1)
            )
            closure_loss = sigmas[:, -1].mean()
            total = pred_loss + self.closure_weight * closure_loss
            return logits, total, {
                'pred': pred_loss.item(),
                'closure': closure_loss.item(),
                'sigma_mean': sigmas.mean().item(),
                'sigma_final': sigmas[:, -1].mean().item(),
            }
        return logits, sigmas
```

**Training task:** bracket sequences. The system sees a sequence of brackets and predicts the next one. Vocabulary is 3 tokens: "(", ")", EOS. The system has to LEARN from data that "(" and ")" are compositional inverses — this is not hardcoded. If it learns this, the embedding has captured structural coherence from training alone.

**Data:** generate random valid bracket sequences, lengths 4–32, 50K training examples.

**Success criteria:**
- Prediction accuracy > 95% on held-out valid bracket sequences.
- σ_final for valid sequences is measurably lower than σ_final for corrupted sequences (swap two brackets at random positions).
- The model can generate valid bracket sequences autoregressively without producing unmatched brackets.

**What this proves:** a learned embedding on S³ can capture structural coherence from data alone, and the closure signal σ distinguishes coherent from incoherent output.

**What this doesn't prove:** that this works for natural language, or that the self-correcting loop works. Those are Steps 2 and 3.

**Estimated effort:** ~150 lines total, trains in minutes on CPU, results in under a day.

## Step 2: Self-monitoring with color channels

This is where the updated SDK changes the architecture.

The original spec fed σ (one scalar) back to the embedding. Now we feed the full Valence — σ, RGB, W — giving the model five channels of self-awareness instead of one.

```python
class S3EmbedWithValence(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, hidden=32):
        super().__init__()
        # +5 for valence: sigma, R, G, B, W
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(vocab_size + 5, hidden),
            nn.GELU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden, 4),
        )
    def forward(self, one_hot, valence):
        # valence is [sigma, R, G, B, W]
        x = torch.cat([one_hot, valence], dim=-1)
        return F.normalize(self.net(x), dim=-1)
```

At every timestep, the running product C_t is decomposed via the Hopf fibration into channels. The model doesn't just know "I'm drifting" — it knows which way it's drifting. W rising means it's losing track of something that should exist. RGB shifting means ordering is breaking down. The model sees its own coherence state in color, and learns to steer accordingly.

**Computing valence at each step (PyTorch, differentiable):**

```python
def hopf_valence(C):
    """Decompose running product into channels.

    Returns [sigma, R, G, B, W] for each batch element.
    This is the PyTorch equivalent of expose() — differentiable,
    so gradients flow through the channel decomposition.
    """
    w, x, y, z = C[:, 0], C[:, 1], C[:, 2], C[:, 3]
    sigma = torch.acos(torch.clamp(w.abs(), max=1-1e-7))

    # Hopf projection: S³ → S² (base) × S¹ (fiber)
    # Base point on S² (RGB direction)
    denom = torch.clamp(1.0 - w*w, min=1e-12).sqrt()
    R = x / denom
    G = y / denom
    B = z / denom
    # Phase on S¹ (W channel)
    W = torch.atan2((x*x + y*y + z*z).sqrt(), w)

    return torch.stack([sigma, R, G, B, W], dim=-1)
```

**Training:** same bracket task, same data. The model now receives its own Hopf decomposition as input at every step.

**Success criteria:** the valence-aware model produces fewer bracket errors during autoregressive generation than the Step 1 model. Generate 1000 sequences with each model, count invalid ones.

**What this proves:** the model can learn to use the geometric structure of its own coherence state — not just the magnitude, but the direction — to self-correct during generation.

**Estimated effort:** change one class, add the valence function (~30 lines), retrain, compare.

## Step 3: Self-feeding loop with Enkidu

The output of the model becomes input to itself through an external observer.

```
Model generates token
  → token bytes are fed to a Seer (SDK, existing)
  → Seer's state is decomposed via expose() → Valence
  → Valence is fed back as input to S3EmbedWithValence
  → model generates next token, informed by the coherence of its own output
```

In Step 2, the valence came from the internal running product — the model's own hidden state. In Step 3, the valence comes from an external Seer watching the actual output stream. The model sees itself through an external eye.

**But there's more.** Because Enkidu exists, you can run the model's output against a reference stream and get classified incidents in real time:

```python
import closure_sdk as closure

# External eye
seer = closure.Seer()
enkidu = closure.Enkidu()

# Reference stream (known-good bracket sequence)
ref_seer = closure.Seer()
for token in reference_sequence:
    ref_seer.ingest(token)

# Generation loop
for t in range(max_length):
    # Generate next token
    token = model.generate_next(valence_feedback)

    # External monitoring
    token_bytes = token.encode()
    seer.ingest(token_bytes)

    # Decompose the external composition into channels
    valence = closure.expose(seer.state().element)
    valence_feedback = torch.tensor([
        valence.sigma, *valence.base, valence.phase
    ])

    # Optional: classify against reference in real time
    incident = enkidu.ingest(token_bytes, t, "source")
    if incident:
        # The model's output just got reclassified —
        # a record it generated was missing from the reference
        # or arrived in the wrong order
        pass

# After generation, check: did the model's output match the reference?
result = seer.compare(ref_seer)
# result.coherent tells you if the generated sequence matches

# Or: bind the two compositions for a richer check
binding = closure.bind(seer.state().element, ref_seer.state().element)
# binding.relation: "equal" means the model reproduced the reference exactly
# binding.gap: the Valence of whatever distance remains
```

**The feedback hierarchy:**
1. **σ only** (Step 1) — "am I drifting?" One number.
2. **Valence** (Step 2) — "am I drifting, and in which channels?" Five numbers.
3. **External Valence** (Step 3) — "is my actual output drifting, seen from outside?" Same five numbers, but from the external Seer, not the internal state.
4. **External Valence + Incident Stream** (Step 3 extended) — "is my output drifting AND what specific incidents are occurring relative to a reference?" Full incident classification via Enkidu.
5. **Binding** (Step 3 extended) — "is my output equal to, inverse of, or unrelated to the reference?" Identity verification via bind().

Each layer adds diagnostic resolution. The model doesn't just know it's wrong — it knows what kind of wrong, where, and relative to what.

**Success criteria:** the externally-monitored model maintains coherence over longer generated sequences than Step 2. Generate sequences of length 64, 128, 256 — at what length does each model start producing bracket errors? The external-feedback model should degrade later.

**What this proves:** external self-monitoring through the SDK produces more sustained coherent generation than internal self-monitoring alone. The see-decide-embody loop works, and the richer the signal (valence > σ, external > internal), the better the correction.

**Estimated effort:** ~40 lines of wiring between the model and the SDK.

## Step 4: Evolve to S³ Transformer

The RNN validates the geometry but can't parallelize across timesteps during training. For a 512-token sequence, the RNN processes tokens one at a time; a transformer processes all positions simultaneously. Same geometry, parallel training.

### What the geometry replaces

Every major transformer component has a geometric equivalent on S³:

| Standard transformer | S³ Transformer |
|---|---|
| Token embedding (learned) | S3Embed (learned, to unit quaternion) |
| Positional encoding (learned/sinusoidal) | Learned positional quaternions (tiny — context × 4m) |
| Q, K projections (learned, 2.4M/layer) | Learned quaternion rotations (tiny — 4×4 per head) |
| V projection (learned) | Quaternion value (free — the element IS the value) |
| Multi-head attention (learned) | Hopf decomposition (free — 4 natural heads per S³ factor) |
| FFN (learned, 4.7M/layer) | Quaternion composition (free — 28 ops, bilinear, non-commutative) |
| Residual connection | Quaternion multiplication (exact) |
| Layer normalization (learned) | Unit quaternion constraint (free — one normalize call) |
| Output projection (learned) | S3Head (learned, from quaternion) |

### Geodesic attention

Standard attention computes softmax(QK^T / √d) × V with learned Q, K, V projections — 2.4M parameters per layer in GPT-2. On S³, the attention score between two positions is the dot product of their unit quaternions — cos(geodesic distance). No V projection because the quaternion at each position IS the value.

**Content-dependent routing.** Pure geodesic distance gives position-dependent attention but not content-dependent attention. "The bank by the river" needs different attention patterns than "the bank approved the loan." Small learned quaternion rotations per layer solve this — not full d×d projections (2.4M per layer), just a 4×4 rotation per head per S³ factor. With m = 4 factors, that's 4 × 16 = 64 parameters per layer. Tiny, but enough for the attention pattern to depend on what the tokens are, not just where they are.

**Aggregation.** Multi-point SLERP on S³ has no closed form. The practical solution: weighted mean in ℝ⁴, project back to S³ via normalize. This is what Parcollet et al. (2019) use effectively, it's differentiable, it's fast, and the approximation error is small for concentrated distributions — which is exactly what softmax attention produces.

```python
class S3Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, m_factors=4):
        super().__init__()
        self.m = m_factors
        # Learned rotation per factor — content-dependent routing.
        # 4×4 per factor = 16 params per factor.
        self.q_rot = nn.Parameter(
            torch.eye(4).unsqueeze(0).repeat(m_factors, 1, 1)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        """
        x: [B, T, m*4] — unit quaternions at each position, m factors.
        Returns: [B, T, m*4] — attended output, still unit quaternions.
        """
        B, T, D = x.shape
        m = self.m

        # Reshape to [B, T, m, 4]
        x_q = x.view(B, T, m, 4)

        # Content-dependent query: rotate each factor
        q = torch.einsum('mij,btmj->btmi', self.q_rot, x_q)
        q = F.normalize(q, dim=-1)

        # Attention scores: geodesic dot product per factor
        scores = torch.einsum('bimf,bjmf->bijm', q, x_q)
        # Average across factors for routing
        scores = scores.mean(dim=-1)  # [B, T, T]
        weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)

        # Aggregate: weighted mean in ℝ⁴, project back to S³
        agg = torch.einsum('bij,bjd->bid', weights, x)  # [B, T, m*4]
        agg = agg.view(B, T, m, 4)
        agg = F.normalize(agg, dim=-1)
        return agg.view(B, T, D)
```

### Composition layer (replaces FFN)

The FFN in a standard transformer is 4.7M parameters per layer — a learned nonlinear transformation. On S³, quaternion multiplication IS a nonlinear transformation: bilinear, non-commutative, with perfect gradient flow (Theorem 2: Jacobian = 1 everywhere, bi-invariant metric). The residual stream is quaternion composition, not vector addition.

```python
class S3Block(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, m_factors=4):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = S3Attention(m_factors)
        self.m = m_factors

    def forward(self, x):
        B, T, D = x.shape
        m = self.m

        attended = self.attention(x)

        # Residual via quaternion composition (not addition)
        x_q = x.view(B, T, m, 4)
        a_q = attended.view(B, T, m, 4)
        out = F.normalize(qmul(x_q, a_q), dim=-1)
        return out.view(B, T, D)
```

### Full S³ Transformer

```python
class S3Transformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, m_factors=1, n_layers=6,
                 hidden=32, closure_weight=0.1, max_seq_len=512):
        super().__init__()
        self.m = m_factors
        self.dim = 4 * m_factors
        self.vocab_size = vocab_size
        self.closure_weight = closure_weight

        self.embed = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(vocab_size, hidden),
            nn.GELU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden, self.dim),
        )
        # Learned positional quaternions — non-commutativity encodes
        # order, but explicit positions help at initialization.
        self.pos_embed = nn.Parameter(
            torch.randn(max_seq_len, self.dim) * 0.02
        )
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([
            S3Block(m_factors) for _ in range(n_layers)
        ])
        self.head = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(self.dim, hidden),
            nn.GELU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden, vocab_size),
        )

    def forward(self, tokens, targets=None):
        B, T = tokens.shape
        x = F.one_hot(tokens, self.vocab_size).float()
        x = self.embed(x)  # [B, T, 4m]

        # Add positional quaternions, normalize to sphere
        x = x + self.pos_embed[:T]
        x = x.view(B, T, self.m, 4)
        x = F.normalize(x, dim=-1)
        x = x.view(B, T, self.dim)

        # Transformer blocks
        for block in self.blocks:
            x = block(x)

        logits = self.head(x)

        # Closure: σ of final position, first S³ factor
        final_q = x[:, -1, :4]
        sigma_final = torch.acos(
            torch.clamp(final_q[:, 0].abs(), max=1-1e-7)
        )

        if targets is not None:
            pred_loss = F.cross_entropy(
                logits[:, :-1].reshape(-1, logits.size(-1)),
                targets[:, 1:].reshape(-1)
            )
            closure_loss = sigma_final.mean()
            total = pred_loss + self.closure_weight * closure_loss
            return logits, total, {
                'pred': pred_loss.item(),
                'closure': closure_loss.item(),
                'sigma_final': sigma_final.mean().item(),
            }
        return logits
```

### Parameter comparison

```
                        Standard (GPT-2)     S³ Transformer
                        ----------------     ---------------
Embedding               39M                  6.4M
Per-layer attention     2.4M × 12 = 29M     64 × 12 = 768
Per-layer FFN           4.7M × 12 = 56M     0
Per-layer norms         3K × 12 = 36K       0
Head                    (shared w/ embed)    6.4M
Positional              786K                 16K

Total                   ~124M                ~13M
```

13M is almost entirely embedding and head — the lookup tables that convert between tokens and geometry. The processing between them is pure algebra plus tiny learned rotations.

### What the geometry replaces and what it doesn't

The geometry replaces **architectural overhead** — the learned approximations of geometric relationships that standard transformers compute with billions of operations. Q/K/V projections learn to measure similarity; geodesic distance provides it exactly. FFN layers learn nonlinear transformations; quaternion composition provides them exactly. Layer normalization learns scale and bias; the unit sphere provides normalization exactly.

The geometry does **not** replace **stored knowledge**. In standard transformers, facts are stored in FFN layers as key-value memories (Geva et al., 2021). The S³ transformer has no FFN layers — no obvious mechanism for storing factual knowledge. This means:

- **Structural tasks** (coherence, grammar, logical consistency) — S³ should excel. The geometry IS structure.
- **Knowledge tasks** (factual recall, world knowledge) — S³ will underperform same-size standard transformers. Facts need parameters.
- **The interesting question** — how much of language modeling is structure vs knowledge? The benchmarks will tell us.

If knowledge-intensive tasks underperform significantly, the dial is small per-layer FFN layers (not full 4×d wide — maybe d×d, adding ~6K per layer). This trades parameter efficiency for knowledge capacity. The right trade-off is empirical.

**Success criteria for the transformer (brackets):**
- Matches or beats the S³ RNN on bracket generation accuracy.
- Training is faster than the RNN at sequence length > 64 (parallelism pays off).

**Estimated effort:** ~100 lines beyond what's already written.

## Step 5: Chain persistence via Closure Observer

Replace the in-memory output log with a persistent, externally monitored stream. The Closure CLI's observer mode provides the infrastructure.

The model generates tokens. The tokens are written to an output stream (a file, a pipe, a chain). Closure Observer watches that stream alongside a reference stream. Incidents are classified in real time. The observer's output feeds back to the model.

```bash
# The model writes to a pipe
python brahman_generate.py > /tmp/brahman_output

# Closure Observer watches the model's output against a reference
closure observer /tmp/brahman_output /tmp/reference_stream --output /tmp/report.json

# Or for full per-record classification:
closure seeker /tmp/brahman_output /tmp/reference_stream --output /tmp/incidents.json
```

The model reads incidents from the observer's output and incorporates them as feedback. The tokens are permanent — written to the stream, monitored externally, consequences visible.

For chain persistence specifically: the output stream is a blockchain. The tokens become extrinsics, the closure observer monitors the chain, and the model sees the permanent record of its own actions.

**What this proves:** the complete see-decide-embody architecture works end to end on real infrastructure, with permanent consequences and geometric self-monitoring enriched by full color channel decomposition.

**Estimated effort:** the CLI handles the monitoring. The model-side wiring is ~30 lines — read incidents from the observer's JSONL output, convert to tensors, feed back.

## The binding property

Every intermediate composition in both the RNN and the transformer is:
- A valid point on S³
- 32 bytes (SHA-256 at entry)
- Composable with any other point
- Bindable to any other composition

Two models processing the same input produce compositions that can be bound — verified for agreement without sharing weights, activations, or architecture. The RNN and the transformer can be bound against each other on the same input. If the geometry is capturing the same structure, their compositions should be close.

Model agreement becomes geometric verification. Different architectures, different sizes, different training — if they produce compositions that bind equal, they agree on the structure. Not the tokens. The structure.

---

## Known hurdles (real ones)

**4D hidden state is small.** Four numbers encode the entire history. For brackets this is fine — nesting depth is essentially one degree of freedom. For richer tasks (language, multi-channel data), 4D will be insufficient. Two independent scaling dials, both of which preserve all theorems:

**Dial 1: Torus channels (T^k).** Switch from S³ to T^k × S³. Each torus channel is an independent signed scalar (angle on S¹) that composes by addition mod 2π. k = 64 gives 68 dimensions.

**Dial 2: Multiple non-commutative channels ((S³)^m).** Language has multiple independent order-sensitive structures — syntax, semantic roles, discourse. One S³ factor may not be enough. The product group T^k × (S³)^m provides m independent non-commutative channels. Each is an independent quaternion composition running in parallel. Still a compact Lie group with bi-invariant metric. Theorems 1 and 2 still hold.

Implementation of (S³)^m is trivial — m independent qmul calls in parallel:

```python
def product_group_compose(state, element, k, m):
    """Compose on T^k × (S³)^m.

    state, element: tensors of shape (..., k + 4*m)
    First k dims: torus (addition mod 2π)
    Next 4*m dims: m quaternions (Hamilton product each)
    """
    torus = (state[..., :k] + element[..., :k]) % (2 * math.pi)
    quats = []
    for i in range(m):
        s = 4 * i + k
        q_state = state[..., s:s+4]
        q_elem = element[..., s:s+4]
        quats.append(F.normalize(qmul(q_state, q_elem), dim=-1))
    return torch.cat([torus] + quats, dim=-1)
```

**Note on valence for product groups:** each S³ factor produces its own Hopf decomposition. With m = 4 non-commutative channels, the model receives 4 independent Valences — 20 channels of self-awareness. Each channel tracks a different aspect of compositional coherence. The torus channels add k more scalar phases. The feedback signal scales with the group.

| Configuration | Dimensions | Valence channels | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| S³ | 4 | 5 (σ, R, G, B, W) | Brackets, proof of concept |
| T^64 × S³ | 68 | 5 + 64 phases | First language attempt |
| T^64 × (S³)^4 | 80 | 20 + 64 phases | Language with multi-channel syntax |
| T^128 × (S³)^8 | 160 | 40 + 128 phases | Rich semantic structure |
| T^256 × (S³)^16 | 320 | 80 + 256 phases | Upper bound |

**Embedding quality determines everything.** The geometry guarantees that IF the embedding maps coherent inputs to quaternions that compose toward identity, THEN coherence is measurable and exact. Whether a learned embedding actually does this for a given domain is empirical. The bracket experiment tests this for structural coherence. Natural language is harder and further away. Each new domain requires validating that the embedding works for that domain.

**Sequential composition (RNN) is O(n), not O(1).** Each token requires one quaternion multiply with the running product. This is fast (28 arithmetic ops per token, microseconds) and the constant is tiny, but it's sequential — you can't parallelize across timesteps the way a transformer parallelizes across positions. For training on long sequences, the RNN could be significantly slower. This is why Step 4 introduces the transformer — same geometry, parallel training.

**The aggregation approximation.** The S³ Transformer aggregates attended quaternions via weighted mean in ℝ⁴ followed by projection back to S³. This is an approximation — the true Fréchet mean on S³ requires iterative computation. The approximation is accurate when the attended quaternions are clustered (which softmax attention produces), but may introduce error for diffuse attention patterns. Monitor the pre-normalization norm during training: if it's consistently below 0.3, the approximation is breaking and you need iterative Fréchet means or sharper attention.

**Content-dependent routing is limited.** The S³ Transformer uses small learned rotations (4×4 per head per factor) for content-dependent attention. This is vastly less expressive than full Q/K/V projections. If the model underperforms on tasks requiring complex content-dependent routing (coreference resolution, long-range dependencies), the rotation capacity may need to increase. The dial: grow from 4×4 rotations to small learned quaternion MLPs per head — still much smaller than full d×d projections, but more expressive.

**The closure loss at the end of the sequence means the gradient signal for early tokens passes through the full composition chain.** Theorem 2 guarantees uniform sensitivity at the infinitesimal level (the Jacobian = 1 everywhere), so in principle early tokens get the same gradient magnitude as late tokens. In practice, finite-precision arithmetic and the specific curvature of the loss landscape may still cause issues at very long sequence lengths. Monitor gradient norms during training. If they degrade, add intermediate closure checkpoints (compute σ every N tokens and add to loss).

**What "closure" means for language.** Brackets close because open and close are algebraic inverses. Natural language doesn't have obvious algebraic closure. The closure loss pressures sequences toward identity — but not all good text "closes" in the bracket sense. For language, σ should correlate with coherence (well-structured text drifts less than incoherent text), not necessarily reach zero. The success criterion is correlation (r > 0.3), not exact closure. Whether the embedding discovers a meaningful closure structure for language is the central empirical question.

## Experimental: Character-Level S³

### Why character-level follows from what the experiments proved

The bracket experiment used 3 atomic tokens: (, ), EOS. The embedding learned that ( and ) are compositional inverses — rotations on S³ that compose to identity. 1,031 parameters. The model didn't memorize bracket sequences. It learned the SHAPE of brackets: two rotations and their algebraic relationship.

This has a direct implication that the original spec missed.

The original spec assumes BPE tokenization with 50K tokens, following the standard transformer playbook. BPE exists because standard transformers can't handle long sequences efficiently — quadratic attention makes character-level prohibitive, so you pre-compose 4–5 characters into one token to keep sequences short. But BPE breaks the compositional hierarchy. "un" + "do" ≠ the BPE token "undo." The tokenizer destroys exactly the compositional structure that S³ is built to capture.

On S³, composition IS the architecture. The running product naturally composes characters into words, words into phrases, phrases into meaning. The geometry doesn't need BPE to compress sequences — it compresses them algebraically through the group operation. And the bracket experiment proved this works: atomic symbols in, compositional structure out, learned from data alone.

Characters are atomic symbols. The alphabet is a 26-element vocabulary (plus punctuation, digits, space — roughly 100 tokens). If the embedding learns the right rotations for each character, then every word is a composition of character rotations. Every sentence is a composition of word rotations. Every relationship between concepts is a path on the manifold. You don't store relationships as weight patterns — you compose them.

### The knowledge argument

Standard models store knowledge as patterns in FFN weights (Geva et al., 2021). Each fact occupies parameters. More facts require more parameters. This is why frontier models are 200B+.

But the bracket experiment contradicts this framing. The model doesn't "store" the fact that ( and ) are inverses. It learns two embeddings whose geometric relationship IS the fact. The knowledge is the geometry, not the weights. The weights learn the geometry, and then the geometry handles everything else through composition.

If meanings are rotations, then knowledge is relationships between embeddings, and relationships are compositions. How many parameters does that require?

The embedding table: 100 characters × 80 dimensions = 8,000 parameters. That's where the knowledge lives. Each character is a point on T^k × (S³)^m. The relationship between any two characters is their composition — it falls out of the group operation. The relationship between any two words is the composition of their character compositions. You don't store word-level or sentence-level knowledge separately — it composes upward from characters, exactly as the bracket experiment composed structural coherence from ( and ).

Human knowledge, estimated:
- All scientific papers ever written: ~200 million
- All books: ~130 million
- Wikipedia: ~70 million articles
- Total text: ~1 trillion characters

But the MODEL doesn't store the text. It stores the GEOMETRY that generates it: 100 character embeddings on an 80-dimensional manifold. The training data teaches the embedding which rotations are right. Once learned, the model composes characters into meaning the same way it composes brackets into closure.

The open question is whether 80 dimensions is enough geometric room for the compositional structure of natural language. The dimensionality sweep answers this. But the mechanism — atomic tokens composing on a Lie group to produce structural coherence — is proven.

### Architecture

Character-level S³ Transformer on T^64 × (S³)^4 (80D hidden state):

```
Input: characters (a–z, A–Z, 0–9, punctuation, space, EOS)
Vocab: ~100 tokens
Hidden: T^64 × (S³)^4 = 80 dimensions

Embedding:   100 × 80        =    8,000 params
Pos quats:   2048 × 80       =  164,000 params    (max context)
Rotations:   6 layers × 64   =      384 params    (geodesic attention)
Head:        80 × 100        =    8,000 params

Total:                         ~180,000 params
```

For comparison:

| Model | Parameters | Vocab | Knowledge storage |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPT-2 | 124,000,000 | 50,257 (BPE) | FFN weights (56M) |
| Brahman BPE (original spec) | 13,000,000 | 50,000 (BPE) | Embedding table (4M) |
| **Brahman character-level** | **180,000** | **100 (characters)** | **Embedding table (8K)** |

The 180K model is 700× smaller than GPT-2. Almost all of that reduction comes from two sources: (1) the geometry replaces learned transforms (Q/K/V, FFN, layer norm), and (2) character-level vocabulary replaces BPE, shrinking the embedding table from millions to thousands.

### Why character-level helps rather than hurts

**Longer sequences:** Character-level text is 4–5× longer than BPE. For standard transformers with O(T²) attention, this is prohibitive — 5× longer sequences means 25× more compute. For the S³ architecture:

- The S³ RNN is O(T) with constant memory. Longer sequences cost proportionally more time but no more memory. The running product naturally compresses the full history into 80 numbers at every step.
- The S³ Transformer has geodesic attention (still O(T²)), but with 64 learned parameters per layer instead of 2.4M. The constant is ~40,000× smaller. A 5× increase in sequence length with a 40,000× decrease in per-comparison cost is a net win.

**No out-of-vocabulary problem:** BPE tokenizers choke on novel words, misspellings, code, math notation, multilingual text. Character-level models handle anything composed of characters. A character-level S³ model trained on English can process French, code, or mathematical notation without retraining — the characters are the same, the compositions are different.

**Full compositional hierarchy:** BPE flattens the hierarchy: characters → [compressed into tokens] → attention patterns → meaning. Character-level S³ preserves the full hierarchy: characters → character compositions (words) → word compositions (phrases) → phrase compositions (sentences) → meaning. Every level is algebraic composition on the same manifold. The geometry operates at every scale simultaneously.

**Natural morphology:** "un-" + "do" = reversal of "do." On S³, this is literal: the rotation for "un-" should compose with the rotation for "do" to produce a rotation near the inverse of "do" alone. The model can learn morphological structure because the algebra supports it natively. BPE destroys this by merging "undo" into a single token.

### Comparison: BPE spec vs character-level

| | BPE (original spec) | Character-level |
|---|---|---|
| Follows from bracket results? | Partially — atomic mechanism + scaling assumption | Directly — atomic tokens compose on S³ |
| Vocabulary | 50K (pre-composed) | 100 (atomic) |
| Parameters | ~13M | ~180K |
| Compositional hierarchy | Truncated at token level | Full, from character to meaning |
| Knowledge storage | 4M in embedding table | 8K in embedding table |
| Out-of-vocabulary | Yes, BPE failures | No, handles any text |
| Sequence length | ~512 tokens (~2K chars) | ~2048 characters |
| Training compute | Hours on A100 | Hours on A100 (longer seqs, but smaller model) |
| What it tests | "Can S³ scale to language?" | "Is composition on S³ sufficient for language?" |

The character-level model asks a sharper question. The BPE model tests scaling. The character-level model tests the MECHANISM — whether atomic composition on S³ is enough. If 180K parameters on characters produces coherent text, the implication is that most of what current models learn is compositional structure that the geometry provides exactly. If it doesn't work, we learn where the geometry breaks and what needs to be added.

### What to add if 180K isn't enough

The 180K model has no capacity beyond the embedding table and tiny attention rotations. If it underperforms, there are two minimal additions before going to full BPE:

**1. Learned composition gates (small).** A small per-layer MLP (80 → 80, ~6,400 params per layer) that modulates the quaternion composition. Not a full FFN — a gate that adjusts HOW characters compose based on context. 6 layers × 6,400 = 38,400 additional parameters. Total: ~220K.

**2. Wider character embedding (small).** Instead of 80D per character, use 160D (T^128 × (S³)^8). Doubles the embedding to 16K parameters and the positional table to 328K. Total: ~350K. Still 350× smaller than GPT-2.

**3. Subword composition layer (medium).** An explicit learned layer that composes character embeddings into word-level representations before feeding to the transformer. This reclaims some of what BPE provides while preserving the compositional hierarchy. Adds ~50K–100K parameters depending on design. Total: ~250K–300K.

None of these compromise the core: the processing is geometric, the knowledge is in the embedding, the overhead is near zero.

Step 5 is the critical path. Step 4 answered the Drawing Board question for token generation: σ loss alone causes embedding collapse, so the optimizer needs neural paths (a small network) and cross-entropy to keep embeddings distinct. Step 3b (Enkidu Alive) showed the other side: when the environment provides the gradient instead of a loss function, pure geometry produces behavioral emergence with no neural overhead at all. The architecture going forward uses the S3Transformer with cross-entropy for sequence generation, σ as a free diagnostic channel, and recognises that the lowest level of the staircase (homeostatic behavior) needs no learning. Step 5 tests the sequence generation path on language.

### Success criteria (character-level, binary)

| Test | Pass | Fail |
|---|---|---|
| Brackets (transformer) | Matches or beats RNN | Worse than RNN |
| TinyStories (coherence) | Generated text is mostly grammatical | Gibberish |
| σ-coherence correlation | r > 0.3 | No correlation |
| Channel separation | Hopf channels distinguish error types | Channels are noise |
| 180K vs 124M GPT-2 | Within 3× perplexity on structural tasks | Worse by > 5× |
| Dimensionality plateau | Clear plateau in sweep | Monotonic (no natural scale) |

### Compute estimate

| Step | Hardware | Time | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 (pure geometry) | CPU, laptop | 3 minutes | Free ✓ |
| 5 (TinyStories) | Colab A100 | 2–6 hours | Free tier or $10 |
| 6 (evaluation) | Same session | Minutes | — |
| 7 (dimensionality sweep) | Colab A100 | 1–3 days | $10–30 |
| 8 (scale) | Colab A100 or RunPod | Days | $50–200 |

The entire character-level experiment — from transformer validation through the dimensionality sweep — fits within $50 of Colab compute. The 180K model trains in hours, not days. The sweep is 10–15 runs of the same small model.

## What to monitor during training

**pred_loss (prediction loss):** should decrease steadily. If flat: learning rate is wrong or model isn't expressive enough. If it oscillates wildly: learning rate too high.

**closure_loss (σ at sequence end):** should decrease. If it stays high while pred_loss drops: the model is ignoring the geometry — increase λ. If it drops to zero immediately: λ is too high, the model is trivially satisfying closure — decrease λ.

**sigma_mean (average σ across all timesteps):** shows the trajectory during a sequence. For valid brackets, σ should rise during nesting and fall as brackets close. Always near zero = embeddings too close to identity. Always near π = embeddings too far, composition is chaotic.

**valence channels (Step 2+):** W should track nesting depth. RGB should track ordering. If W correlates with missing-bracket errors and RGB correlates with ordering errors during validation, the Hopf decomposition is capturing meaningful structure in the hidden state.

**attention pattern diversity (Step 4+):** different layers should develop different attention patterns. If all layers attend uniformly, the learned rotations aren't learning — increase rotation capacity.

**aggregation residual (Step 4+):** the norm of the pre-normalized weighted mean in ℝ⁴. Should stay above 0.7 for the projection approximation to be accurate. If it drops below 0.3 consistently, switch to iterative Fréchet means.

**gradient norms:** should be stable. If they explode (> 100): add gradient clipping. If they vanish (< 1e-7): learning rate too low or model is stuck. Theorem 2 guarantees uniform sensitivity, so vanishing should be rare.

**Validation metrics every N epochs:**
- Generate 1000 bracket sequences autoregressively.
- Count how many are valid.
- Compute σ_final and full Valence for each.
- Report: % valid, mean σ for valid vs invalid, channel separation between valid and invalid.
- The channel separation is the key metric — do W and RGB distinguish different failure modes?

## Compute requirements

**Steps 1–5 (brackets, both architectures):** CPU is sufficient. ~5,000 parameters (RNN), ~50K parameters (transformer with m=1). Trains in minutes on CPU. No cloud compute needed.

**Scaling to language:** vocabulary jumps to 30K–50K tokens. With T^64 × (S³)^4 (80D hidden state), roughly 13M parameters.

| Hardware | 13M param training on ~1GB text |
|---|---|
| RTX 2070 (8GB VRAM, local) | Days |
| Colab Pro A100 ($10/month) | Hours |
| RunPod A100 ($1-2/hour) | Weekend, ~$50-100 |

## The dimensionality experiment

The intrinsic dimensionality of semantic state has never been measured. Standard architectures conflate semantic capacity with architectural overhead. This architecture isolates the semantic component — every dimension is pure semantic state.

Train across configurations on the same corpus. Measure perplexity, σ-coherence correlation, channel separation, generation quality. Plot against dimensionality. The plateau tells you the intrinsic dimensionality of compositional meaning.

**Prediction:** the plateau lands in the range 60–160. Not 4 (too few for language). Not 768 (that's architectural overhead). If it lands between 60–80, that would match human working memory capacity (Miller's 7 ± 2 chunks, each chunk composing multiple channels) measured by independent means.

**What the transformer adds to this experiment:** parallel training makes the sweep tractable. An RNN sweep at language scale would take weeks per configuration. The transformer cuts that to days. Same geometry, same measurements, faster iteration.

## Success criteria (binary, no ambiguity)

| Phase | Pass | Fail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (brackets, σ only) | **PASSED** — σ separates valid/invalid, inverses learned from data | ~~No separation~~ |
| 2 (brackets, valence) | **PASSED** — 99.1% pair accuracy (vs 87.5%), 2× longer generation, lower pred loss | ~~No improvement~~ |
| 2 (channels) | W and RGB separate missing-type vs ordering-type errors | Channels are noise |
| 3 (external loop) | External feedback extends coherent generation length vs Step 2 | No improvement |
| 3b (grid walk) | **PASSED (generation)** — 98.3% closed walks. **Key insight:** neural overhead bypasses geometry | ~~Geometry drives generation~~ |
| 4 (pure geometry) | ~~Drawing Board model discovers inverses from σ alone~~ | **ANSWERED** — for token generation, σ alone causes embedding collapse; neural paths needed. For behavioral emergence (Enkidu Alive), σ alone suffices when the environment provides the gradient |
| 5 (persistence) | Full loop runs: generate → persist → observe → feedback → adjust | Breaks |
| Language (perplexity) | Within 2× of same-size transformer | Worse by > 2× |
| Language (coherence) | σ correlates with human-judged coherence (r > 0.3) | No correlation |
| Language (dimensionality) | Clear plateau in σ-coherence vs dimensions | Monotonic (no natural scale) |
| Language (structural) | σ + Valence detect >50% of structural errors (contradictions, dropped context) | Chance level |
| Language (knowledge) | Factual recall within 5× of same-param standard transformer | Worse by > 5× |

Phase 1 is a weekend. Phase 2 adds channels to the same weekend. Phase 3 wires the SDK — a few hours. Phase 4 builds the transformer — a day. Phase 5 wires the CLI — an afternoon. Language is a cloud GPU rental. Competitive validation is a research partnership.

## What requires a research lab (and what doesn't)

### The mechanism validation + transformer evolution is small

Steps 1–17: ~300 lines Python, CPU, one session to a weekend. Anyone with PyTorch can do this.

### The dimensionality sweep is small

18–30 runs of models between 13M and 55M parameters on TinyStories. Single A100, 1–2 weeks, $200–500.

### What IS big: validation at competitive scale

| | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Model size | 100M–1B params |
| Corpus | The Pile, RedPajama, or equivalent (100B+ tokens) |
| Benchmarks | MMLU, HumanEval, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA |
| Hardware | 8–64 A100s |
| Cost | $10K–100K |

This is where a lab adds value — not for the compute, but for benchmark pipelines, infrastructure, and credibility.

### The pitch

1. **A 13M-parameter S³ transformer matches or beats a 124M-parameter standard transformer on structural language tasks.** The geometry replaces architectural overhead.

2. **σ and the Valence channels are real-time coherence monitors that require no additional training.** They fall out of the geometry for free. No RLHF, no retrieval augmentation, no chain-of-thought scaffolding. And the channels don't just detect — they diagnose. W tells you the model lost track of something; RGB tells you ordering broke down. Structural incoherence becomes not just measurable but classifiable.

3. **The intrinsic dimensionality of compositional structure is measurable for the first time.** The plateau in the dimensionality sweep is a fundamental quantity about language and cognition that has never been measured.

Any one of these, if validated, is a top-tier publication. All three emerge from the same experiment.

## Dependencies

```
Step 1–5:   PyTorch, closure_sdk (built), closure_cli (built)
Step 18+:   GPU, TinyStories dataset
```

The bracket validation (Steps 1–10) can begin today. The transformer evolution (Steps 11–15) builds directly on it. The CLI (Step 5) is built. Language scaling requires a GPU and the dimensionality sweep planned.
