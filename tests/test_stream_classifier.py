"""Tests for StreamClassifier — the online matcher in canon.py.

The classifier answers one binary question per cycle for each unresolved
record: is this an invertibility of payload (missing) or position (reorder)?

Three scenarios at each tick:
    1. Both sides receive the same record → coherent, no incident.
    2. One side receives a record that arrives late → reorder.
    3. One side receives a record that never arrives → missing.

The grace period turns the oracle problem (we can't see the future)
into a bounded binary decision.
